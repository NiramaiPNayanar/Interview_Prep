# Interview_Prep

This repository is a work-in-progress collection of curated resources Iâ€™m using to prepare for my placement process. Iâ€™ll continue updating it as I find more helpful tools and guides.

## ðŸ“š Current Resources

- **Cheat Sheets**  
  I highly recommend the collection at [Educative.io Cheatsheets](https://www.educative.io/cheatsheets) for quick references and key concepts. 

- **Basic Code Samples & Interview Stages**  
  The [LeetCode Cheatsheet Explore Card](https://leetcode.com/explore/interview/card/cheatsheets/720/resources/4724/) provides a solid overview of fundamental coding patterns and outlines common interview stages.

- **Interview Practice Tool**  
  Google's [Interview Warmup](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/interview_warmup/category) is a great interactive tool to practice answering common interview questions in various domains.
